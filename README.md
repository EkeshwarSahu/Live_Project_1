## __Consumer Creditworthiness Analysis__

 __Overview:__
 It is a machine learning project in the banking domain. It is a banking data which contains information about the status of loan approval. Since bank receives many loans applications on the daily basis. So, the higher management notices that this takes significant amount of time of employees and also since the number of applications for loan approval are also very high that is why they are not able to filter the appropriate candidature for loan approval. 

 __Objective:__
The objective of this exercise is to build a machine model, using historical banking data that will help the bank employees to determine appropriate candidature for the loan approval.
